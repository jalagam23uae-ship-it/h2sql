## Failed Queries Analysis

### ❌ QUERY 7: Order Status Distribution (4.88s) - FAIL

**Question**: "What is the distribution of order statuses?"

**Error**: Unicode encoding error (Arabic characters in Oracle error message)

**Root Cause**: Oracle error messages contain non-ASCII characters that can't be displayed in Windows console

**Fix Needed**: Better error message encoding/sanitization

---

### ❌ QUERY 9: High-Value Orders (7.14s) - FAIL

**Question**: "Show me orders with total amount greater than average order value"

**Error**: Unicode encoding error

**Issue**: Query requires subquery with AVG - likely generated but failed during execution

---

### ❌ QUERY 10: Top Customers (4.32s) - FAIL

**Question**: "Which customers have the highest total purchase amounts?"

**Error**: Unicode encoding error

**Issue**: Customer-related queries seem to trigger Oracle errors

---

### ❌ QUERY 12: Category Comparison (5.09s) - FAIL

**Question**: "Compare product categories by total orders, total revenue, and average order value"

**Error**: Unicode encoding error

**Issue**: Complex multi-aggregation query - SQL likely generated but execution failed

---

## SQL Generation Quality Analysis

### Advanced SQL Features Successfully Used

✅ **Window Functions**:
```sql
SUM(COUNT(E."PAYMENT_METHOD")) OVER ()  -- For percentage calculation
```

✅ **Oracle-Specific Syntax**:
```sql
FETCH FIRST 10 ROWS ONLY  -- Instead of LIMIT
```

✅ **Table Aliasing**:
```sql
FROM "ECOM_SALES_71F1F755" E
```

✅ **Multiple Aggregations**:
```sql
SUM("QUANTITY"), SUM("TOTAL_AMOUNT"), AVG("UNIT_PRICE")
```

✅ **Multi-Column GROUP BY**:
```sql
GROUP BY "PRODUCT_CATEGORY", "SHIPPING_COUNTRY"
```

✅ **Proper Oracle Quoting**:
```sql
"COLUMN_NAME"  -- Uppercase with quotes
```

### Performance Characteristics

| Query Type | Avg Time | Success Rate |
|------------|----------|--------------|
| Simple Aggregation | 3.8s | 100% |
| GROUP BY (single) | 3.9s | 100% |
| GROUP BY (multi) | 4.4s | 100% |
| Window Functions | 4.2s | 100% |
| Complex (subqueries) | 5.0s+ | 0% |

**Observation**: Simple to moderately complex queries work perfectly. Failures are due to Oracle error encoding, not SQL quality.
