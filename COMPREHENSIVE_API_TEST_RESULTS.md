## Executive Summary

Tested all 5 data upload API endpoints with both success and failure scenarios. Core functionality is working for most endpoints, with some expected failures and configuration issues identified.

### Endpoint Status Overview

| Endpoint | Success Rate | Status | Notes |
|----------|--------------|--------|-------|
| `/upload` | 100% (6/6) | ✅ EXCELLENT | All success and failure cases working correctly |
| `/recommendations/question` | 0% (0/3) | ❌ UNAVAILABLE | Method Not Allowed (405) - Wrong HTTP method or route |
| `/generatereport` | 100% (5/5) | ✅ EXCELLENT | Both Mode 1 (SQL) and Mode 3 (NL) working |
| `/executequey` | 50% (3/6) | ⚠️ PARTIAL | Core functionality works, error handling issues |
| `/graph` | 25% (1/4) | ❌ NEEDS FIX | Missing required `response_id` field |

---

## 1. Upload Endpoint - ✅ EXCELLENT (100%)

**Endpoint:** `POST /h2s/data-upload/upload`

### Test Results

| Test Case | Result | Details |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| Upload CSV file | ✅ PASS | Uploaded: TEST_CUSTOMERS_1BA0534B, Rows: 793 |
| Upload Excel file | ✅ PASS | Uploaded: TEST_ROLES_F114BC9A, Rows: 207 |
| Upload without file | ✅ PASS | Correctly rejected: 422 |
| Upload without project_id | ✅ PASS | Correctly rejected: 422 |
| Upload with invalid project_id | ✅ PASS | Correctly rejected: 500 |
| Upload invalid file type | ✅ PASS | Correctly rejected: 500 |

### Analysis

**Strengths:**
- ✅ Successfully processes CSV and Excel files
- ✅ Proper file parsing and table creation
- ✅ Correct row count insertion (793 and 207 rows)
- ✅ Proper validation of required fields
- ✅ Good error handling for invalid inputs

**Sample Success Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Uploaded and processed test_customers.csv",
  "projectId": 22,
  "tableName": "TEST_CUSTOMERS_1BA0534B",
  "rowsInserted": 793
}
```

**Validation:**
- Missing file → 422 Unprocessable Entity
- Missing project_id → 422 Unprocessable Entity
- Invalid project_id → 500 Internal Server Error
- Invalid file type (.txt) → 500 Internal Server Error

---

## 2. Recommendations Endpoint - ❌ UNAVAILABLE (0%)

**Endpoint:** `GET /h2s/data-upload/recommendations/question`

### Test Results

| Test Case | Result | Details |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| Get recommendations (success) | ❌ FAIL | Status 405: Method Not Allowed |
| Get recommendations without project_id | ❌ FAIL | Expected 400/422/501, got 405 |
| Get recommendations with invalid project_id | ❌ FAIL | Expected 404/500/501, got 405 |

### Analysis

**Issue:** HTTP 405 Method Not Allowed

**Possible Causes:**
1. **Wrong HTTP Method:** Endpoint may expect POST instead of GET
2. **Wrong Route:** Route may be different (e.g., `/recommendations` instead of `/recommendations/question`)
3. **Not Implemented:** Endpoint not registered in router

**Error Response:**
```json
{"detail": "Method Not Allowed"}
```

**Recommendation:** Check the router configuration in `data_upload_api.py` to find the correct route and HTTP method.

**Expected Behavior:**
- Should return list of recommended questions for a project
- Previously mentioned as returning 501 Not Implemented
- ORM models missing (db.recomendation_group, db.recomendation_questions)

---

## 3. Generate Report Endpoint - ✅ EXCELLENT (100%)

**Endpoint:** `POST /h2s/data-upload/generatereport`

### Test Results

| Test Case | Result | Details |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| Mode 1: Direct SQL | ✅ PASS | Generated HTML: 9,839 chars |
| Mode 3: Natural Language | ✅ PASS | Generated HTML: 9,946 chars |
| Missing params | ✅ PASS | Correctly rejected: 400 |
| Invalid project_id | ✅ PASS | Correctly rejected: 404 |
| Invalid SQL | ✅ PASS | Correctly rejected: 400 |

### Analysis

**Strengths:**
- ✅ Mode 1 (Direct SQL) working perfectly
- ✅ Mode 3 (Natural Language with LLM) working!
- ✅ Generates interactive HTML reports with Chart.js
- ✅ Proper validation and error handling
- ✅ LLM integration successful (llama4:16x17b via Ollama)

**Mode 1 Sample Request:**
```json
{
  "projectId": 22,
  "recomended_questions": [{
    "recomended_qstn_id": "test_report_1",
    "sql_query": "SELECT COUNT(*) as total FROM \"CUSTOMERS_59C96545\"",
    "question": "Total customers"
  }]
}
```

**Mode 3 Sample Request:**
```json
{
  "projectId": 22,
  "question": "how many customers are there in total"
}
```

**Response:** HTML document (~10KB) with:
- Interactive Chart.js visualizations
- Chart type switcher (bar, line, pie, doughnut, etc.)
- Export to PNG functionality
- Responsive design

**LLM Performance:**
- Successfully generates SQL from natural language
- Proper PostgreSQL syntax with quoted identifiers
- Response time: ~5-10 seconds

## 4. Execute Query Endpoint - ⚠️ PARTIAL (50%)

**Endpoint:** `POST /h2s/data-upload/executequey`

### Test Results

| Test Case | Result | Details |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| Execute valid query | ✅ PASS | Query executed successfully |
| Execute with cache | ✅ PASS | Query executed (possibly cached) |
| Execute without query | ❌ FAIL | Timeout after 10 seconds |
| Execute with invalid project_id | ✅ PASS | Correctly rejected: 404 |
| Execute invalid SQL | ❌ FAIL | Expected 400/500, got 200 |
| Execute on non-existent table | ❌ FAIL | Expected 400/500, got 200 |

### Analysis

**Strengths:**
- ✅ Core query execution working
- ✅ Caching mechanism appears functional
- ✅ Validates project_id correctly

**Issues:**

**1. Timeout on Missing Query Parameter:**
- Test timed out after 10 seconds
- Suggests endpoint doesn't validate required parameters immediately
- May be trying to generate SQL from question without query field

**2. Invalid SQL Returns 200 OK:**
```
Test: Execute invalid SQL
Expected: 400 or 500
Actual: 200 OK
```

This is a **problem** - invalid SQL should not return success status.

**3. Non-existent Table Returns 200 OK:**
```
Test: Execute query on non-existent table
Expected: 400 or 500
Actual: 200 OK
```

This suggests the endpoint may be catching database errors and returning them in a 200 response instead of using proper HTTP status codes.

**Likely Response Format for Errors:**
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": "table does not exist",
  "rows": []
}
```

**Recommendation:** Update endpoint to return proper HTTP status codes:
- 400 Bad Request for invalid SQL syntax
- 404 Not Found for non-existent tables
- 500 Internal Server Error for database errors

**Sample Success Request:**
```json
{
  "project_id": 22,
  "question": "How many customers are there?",
  "query": "SELECT COUNT(*) as total FROM \"CUSTOMERS_59C96545\""
}
```

---

## 5. Graph Endpoint - ❌ NEEDS FIX (25%)

**Endpoint:** `POST /h2s/data-upload/graph`

### Test Results

| Test Case | Result | Details |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| Generate graph visualization | ❌ FAIL | Status 422: Missing field `response_id` |
| Generate without query | ✅ PASS | Correctly rejected: 422 |
| Generate with invalid project_id | ❌ FAIL | Expected 404/500, got 422 |
| Generate with invalid SQL | ❌ FAIL | Expected 400/500, got 422 |

### Analysis

**Critical Issue:** Missing required field `response_id`

**Error Response:**
```json
{
  "detail": [
    {
      "type": "missing",
      "loc": ["body", "response_id"],
      "msg": "Field required",
      "input": {
        "project_id": 22,
        "question": "Show customer distribution",
        "query": "SELECT segment, COUNT(*) as count FROM \"CUSTOMERS_59C96545\" GROUP BY segment"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

**Root Cause:** Pydantic request model requires `response_id` field that wasn't included in test.

**Required Request Format:**
```json
{
  "project_id": 22,
  "response_id": "unique_response_id",
  "question": "Show customer distribution",
  "query": "SELECT segment, COUNT(*) as count FROM \"CUSTOMERS_59C96545\" GROUP BY segment"
}
```

**Why This Field Exists:**
- Likely used to cache or track chart specifications
- May be used to retrieve previously generated charts
- Could be related to conversational context

**Issues:**
1. All failure tests return 422 (validation error) instead of testing actual business logic
2. Missing `response_id` prevents testing the core functionality
3. Documentation doesn't mention this required field

**Recommendation:** Update test cases to include `response_id` field.

---

## API Documentation Gaps

Based on testing, the following fields are required but not well-documented:

### Graph Endpoint
**Missing from docs:** `response_id` field is required

**Actual Request Schema:**
```json
{
  "project_id": 22,           // Required
  "response_id": "string",    // Required (not documented)
  "question": "string",        // Required
  "query": "string"            // Required
}
```

### Execute Query Endpoint
**Behavior Note:** Returns 200 OK with error details in body instead of HTTP error codes

**Error Response Format:**
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": "error message",
  "rows": []
}
```

### Recommendations Endpoint
**Status:** Route or method configuration issue - returns 405

**Needs Investigation:**
- Correct HTTP method (GET vs POST)
- Correct route path
- Router registration
