# Generate Report Endpoint Test Summary

**Date:** 2025-10-25
**Endpoint:** `POST /h2s/data-upload/generatereport`
**Project ID:** 22 (test_project)

---

## Test Objective

Test the `/h2s/data-upload/generatereport` endpoint with uploaded data from project 22:
- **CUSTOMERS_59C96545** (793 rows)
- **CUSTOMERROLE_2857A605** (207 rows)
- **EMPLOYEES_WITH_NORMAL_HEADINGS_07A68017** (39 rows)

---

## Issues Found and Fixed

### 1. Project Data Fetching Issue
**Problem:** `generatereport` endpoint was using old `Projects()` service to fetch from external API instead of local database.

**Error:**
```
'dict' object has no attribute 'db_type'
```

**Fix:** Updated [data_upload_api.py](D:\h2sql\app\projects\services\data_upload_api.py#L1816):
```python
# BEFORE (BROKEN):
from projects.services.projects import Projects
projects_service = Projects()
project_data = await projects_service.get_project(request.projectId)
project = Project(**project_data)

# AFTER (FIXED):
project_data = await get_project_by_id(request.projectId, db)
project = project_data["project"]
```

### 2. Missing projects_service Variable
**Problem:** Line 1875 referenced undefined `projects_service` variable when getting database connector.

**Error:**
```
name 'projects_service' is not defined
```

**Fix:** Created connector directly (line 1875-1877):
```python
# BEFORE:
connector = projects_service.get_connector(project)

# AFTER:
import projects.services.db_metadata as metadata
connector = metadata.get_connector(project.connection.db_type)
connector.get_connection(project.connection)
```

### 3. PostgreSQL Case Sensitivity
**Issue:** PostgreSQL table/column names are case-sensitive when quoted, case-insensitive when unquoted (folded to lowercase).

**Tables created:** `CUSTOMERS_59C96545` (uppercase)
**Query without quotes:** `SELECT * FROM CUSTOMERS_59C96545` → searches for "customers_59c96545" (lowercase) → NOT FOUND

**Solution:** Use quoted identifiers in SQL queries:
```sql
-- CORRECT:
SELECT * FROM "CUSTOMERS_59C96545"

-- INCORRECT (will fail):
SELECT * FROM CUSTOMERS_59C96545
```

## Endpoint Modes

The `/h2s/data-upload/generatereport` endpoint supports 3 modes:

### Mode 1: Direct SQL (TESTED - WORKING)
Provide SQL queries directly, bypass LLM generation.

**Request Format:**
```json
{
  "projectId": 22,
  "recomended_questions": [
    {
      "recomended_qstn_id": "test_1",
      "sql_query": "SELECT segment, COUNT(*) as count FROM \"CUSTOMERS_59C96545\" GROUP BY segment",
      "question": "Show customer segments"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Response:** HTML document with interactive Chart.js visualizations (200 OK)

### Mode 2: Fetch from Database
Fetch pre-saved questions from database by ID.

**Request Format:**
```json
{
  "projectId": 22,
  "recomended_qstn_id": "22_group_1_recom_qstn_0"
}
```

**Status:** Not tested (requires pre-saved questions in DB)

### Mode 3: Natural Language (LLM)
Generate SQL from natural language question using LLM.

**Request Format:**
```json
{
  "projectId": 22,
  "question": "show me customer segments and their counts"
}
```

**Status:** NOT WORKING - Unicode encoding issue in prompts.json
**Error:**
```
'charmap' codec can't encode characters in position 2819-2821: character maps to <undefined>
```

**Root Cause:** The prompts.json file contains emoji characters that cannot be encoded on Windows console.

## PostgreSQL Query Examples for Uploaded Data

### Customers Table (CUSTOMERS_59C96545)
```sql
-- Count by segment
SELECT segment, COUNT(*) as count FROM "CUSTOMERS_59C96545" GROUP BY segment ORDER BY count DESC

-- Top cities
SELECT city, state, COUNT(*) as count FROM "CUSTOMERS_59C96545" GROUP BY city, state ORDER BY count DESC LIMIT 10

-- Sample records
SELECT "Customer Id" as customer_id, "Customer Name" as customer_name, city, state, segment
FROM "CUSTOMERS_59C96545" LIMIT 5
```

**Note:** Column names are also case-sensitive. Use `SELECT * FROM "CUSTOMERS_59C96545" LIMIT 1` to see exact column names.

### Customer Roles Table (CUSTOMERROLE_2857A605)
```sql
-- Total count
SELECT COUNT(*) as total_roles FROM "CUSTOMERROLE_2857A605"

-- All records
SELECT * FROM "CUSTOMERROLE_2857A605" LIMIT 10
```

### Employees Table (EMPLOYEES_WITH_NORMAL_HEADINGS_07A68017)
```sql
-- Total count
SELECT COUNT(*) as total_employees FROM "EMPLOYEES_WITH_NORMAL_HEADINGS_07A68017"

-- Group by department (if column exists)
SELECT department, COUNT(*) as count FROM "EMPLOYEES_WITH_NORMAL_HEADINGS_07A68017"
GROUP BY department
```

### Key Findings

1. **Endpoint fully functional** for Mode 1 (direct SQL queries)
2. **HTML visualization working** with Chart.js integration
3. **PostgreSQL case sensitivity** requires quoted identifiers for uppercase table/column names
4. **LLM mode blocked** by unicode encoding issue (pre-existing, not introduced by these changes)
5. **Local database integration** successful - no dependency on external services

### Recommendations

1. **For Production Use:**
   - Use Mode 1 with quoted table names for guaranteed success
   - Fix unicode encoding in prompts.json for Mode 3 support
   - Add column name discovery to avoid case-sensitivity errors

2. **Future Enhancements:**
   - Add JSON response option alongside HTML
   - Implement table/column name case normalization
   - Create SQL query builder helper for proper quoting
